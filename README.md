# Combustion Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes combustion data using Python to study 
and predict lean blowout (LBO) and rich blowout (RBO) 
conditions in premixed flames.

The goal is to understand combustion behavior 
and analyze performance trends using data processing techniques.

## Features
- Data processing and cleaning
- Visualization of combustion trends
- Prediction of blowout conditions

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (if used)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries
3. Run the main script

## Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand combustion data analysis and Python-based engineering computation.
